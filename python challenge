1) Define a method that ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message
num = input("Type a number: ")
num = int(num)
if (num % 2 ==0):
print(num, "is an even number!")
else:
print(num, "is an odd number!")

2) Write a method that takes a number and print its square
square = input("Type a number to find out its square: ")
square = int(square)
result = square**2
print("The result is ", result)

3) Write a method to convert degrees of Fahrenheit to Celsius.
fah = int(input("Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit to convert to Celcius: "))
cel = (fah -32) * 5/9
print(fah, " in Fahrenheit is ", round(cel), " in Celcius")\

4) Create a method that takes a list of numbers. Return the largest number in the list.
lv = [55, 3, 47, 90, 17, 333] 
print(max(lv))

5) Define a method that ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
user_str = str(input("Type a word to know if it is a palindrome: ")) 
rev_user_str = reversed(user_str)
if list(user_str) == list(rev_user_str):
print(user_str + " it is a palindrome")
else:
print(user_str + " it is not a palindrome")

6) Create a method that returns the number of vowels per string.
data = input(("Please type a setence to dicover how may vowels it has: "))
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
for v in vowels:
print(v, data.count(v))
